          <p> The Crazy 8s exercise is a brainstorming technique used to generate ideas quickly and creatively, especially in design and problem-solving contexts. Here's a brief summary of how it works:</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Participants take a sheet of paper and fold it into eight sections, each section representing one idea.</li>
              <br>
              <li><strong>Time Limit:</strong> Typically, each participant is given a set amount of time, usually around 5 minutes, to sketch or write down an idea in each of the eight sections.</li>
              <br>
              <li><strong>Ideation:</strong> Participants brainstorm and sketch their ideas rapidly, focusing on quantity rather than quality. The goal is to generate a diverse range of ideas within the time constraint.</li>
              <br>
              <li><strong>Sharing:</strong> Once the time is up, participants share their ideas with the group, discussing and elaborating on each concept.</li>
              <br>
              <li><strong>Reflection:</strong> After the Crazy 8s session, participants can review the ideas generated, identify promising concepts, and further develop them through discussion or additional iterations of the exercise.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
          <p>Overall, the Crazy 8s exercise encourages creativity, fosters collaboration, and helps teams explore a variety of solutions to a problem in a short amount of time.</p>

      <p>In Week 2 I began building the home page for my website based on a space theme. The theme was chosen from the last idea of my Crazy 8s Exercise and was expanded upon in a paper prototype for the layout of the home page.</p>
      <p>Developments include:
        <ul>
          <li>Experimenting with tiled gif backgrounds</li>
          <br>
          <li>Playing around with the opacity of the planets</li>
          <br>
          <li>Making the planets black and translucent</li>
          <br>
          <li>Applying a coloured gradient to the text of the planets</li>
          <br>
          <li>Animating an effect to display the planets' colour on hover</li>
          <br>
          <li>Experimenting with coloured gradients in the nav bar</li>
        </ul>
