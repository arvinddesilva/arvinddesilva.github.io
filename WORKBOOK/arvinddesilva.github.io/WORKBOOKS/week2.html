          <br>The Crazy 8s exercise is a brainstorming technique used to generate ideas quickly and creatively, especially in design and problem-solving contexts. Here's a brief summary of how it works:
          <br></br><br></br>
          Preparation: Participants take a sheet of paper and fold it into eight sections, each section representing one idea.
          <br></br>
          Time Limit: Typically, each participant is given a set amount of time, usually around 5 minutes, to sketch or write down an idea in each of the eight sections.
          <br></br>
          Ideation: Participants brainstorm and sketch their ideas rapidly, focusing on quantity rather than quality. The goal is to generate a diverse range of ideas within the time constraint.
          <br></br>
          Sharing: Once the time is up, participants share their ideas with the group, discussing and elaborating on each concept.
          <br></br>
          Reflection: After the Crazy 8s session, participants can review the ideas generated, identify promising concepts, and further develop them through discussion or additional iterations of the exercise.
          <br></br><br></br>
          Overall, the Crazy 8s exercise encourages creativity, fosters collaboration, and helps teams explore a variety of solutions to a problem in a short amount of time.</p>
